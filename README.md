# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To perform a heuristic evaluation of two leading e-commerce websites — Amazon and Flipkart — based on Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics, and to develop and incorporate design improvements to enhance their overall user experience (UX).

## Algorithm:
Selection of Platforms:
Choose two similar platforms (Amazon and Flipkart) offering comparable services for fair UX evaluation.

Define Evaluation Criteria:
Apply Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation framework.

Conduct Heuristic Evaluation:

Evaluate each heuristic on both websites.

Identify usability issues and assign severity ratings (1 = minor, 4 = critical).

Record observations in a comparison table.

Analyze Findings:
Compare how each website performs under each heuristic and identify overlapping weaknesses.

Develop Design Improvements:

Propose UI/UX solutions for high-severity issues.

Create prototype concepts (Undo Snackbar, Inline Coupon Validation, Sticky Filter Bar, etc.).

Implement and Incorporate Changes:
Simulate solutions using code snippets and mock layouts to show how the changes improve usability.

Evaluate Outcomes:
Assess how the proposed solutions enhance control, feedback, and efficiency for users.
